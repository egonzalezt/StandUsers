# StandUsers

StandUsers is a microservice designed to manage user accounts efficiently. The name draws inspiration from the popular anime series "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure," where characters possess unique abilities called "Stands." Just like Stands, each user in our system is distinct and empowered with specific attributes and permissions.
